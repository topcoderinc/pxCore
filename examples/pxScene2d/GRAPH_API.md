Unlike `Text`, the height and width of `TextBox` does NOT change based on the text value; instead, the height and width values in constructor and assignments are respected, and the text is rendered within those dimensions, according to the property values, below.  

Behaviors for alignment, wordWrap and clip:

* If truncation is none and wrap is true, then the text will continue to ﬂow beyond the height of the bounding rectangle, possibly cut off if clip is applied;
* If truncation is none, and wrap is false, then the line(s) (that /n case has to be taken into consideration) should be centered in the view, even if the text goes beyond its x/width boundaries. If clip is true, text is cut off on either end. Such as:

`alignHorizontal CENTER`

```
The qu|ick brown fox jumped over the la|zy dog
      |ick brown fox jumped over the la|
```

`alignHorizontal RIGHT`
